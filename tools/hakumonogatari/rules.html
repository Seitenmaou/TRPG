        <h2>Story</h2>
        <p>Ninty-nine stories told.
            Exists a single story left.
            The narrative remains incomplete.
            A story before hundred.
            Ignorant of what hides in stories already told.</p>
            <p>
                You are amongst people, each bringing a ghost story. 99 have been told already. With the 100th one told, there shall be a disaster upon the world. You must prevent the 100th ghost story from being completed.
            </p>

        <h2>Gameplay and Rules</h2>
        <p>If you want the summary, here it is: make the story not scary</p>
        <p>
            <ul>If you want the detailed one:
                <li>There are players (PL) and game master(GM).</li>
               <li> GM will be reading the story, and their objective is to eliminate every PL.</li>
                <li>Each PL has a class and hit points, and their objective is to guess all keywords in the story.</li>
                <li>The story progression as follows:
                    <li><ul>Before the the beggning, GM prepares a story along with keywords (usually 10 keywords).
                        <li>At game start, the PLs will pick a class with set hit points and abilities, along with a number from 1~6.</li>
                        <li>Then the game really begins, GM will read the story, and the PLs (any of the PL, there is no order to follow) will object to a word or phrase</li>
                        <li>An example would be: 
                            <ul>
                                <li>GM: So yesterday I was walking down the street to my school</li>
                                <li>Pl1: wait no, i thought it was jogging , not walking?</li>
                            </ul>
                        </li>
                        <li>Then the player would roll 1d6, or a 6 face dice. As long as they dont land on the number they chose at the beggning, they succeed changing the phrase, otherwise they lose a life point</li>
                        <li>Following the previous example
                            <ul>
                                <li>If Pl1 had chosen the number 3 at the beggning, and he rolled a 3, the word "walking" would not change, and he would lose one life point</li>
                                <li>If PL1 has rolled anything else, EVERY occurence of the word "walk/walking" would change to "jog/jogging" (feel free to be picky or forgiving on words' tense)</li>
                                <li>If PL1 had rolled 3, and that was his last life point, they are eliminated. You can no longer change phrases. (there are exceptions related to class abilities, noted later)</li>
                                <li>If the altered word or phrase containes any of the ten keywords, the GM should announce it on the first occurnece. (due note, they do not have to announce the total or remaining amount of keywords)</li>
                            </ul>
                        </li>
                        <li>This continues until the end of the story, regardless of remaing keywords or players. (its more fun that way!)</li>
                        <li>Once the story is over, check the win condition
                            <ul>
                            <li>GM wins if all players have reached zero hit points</li>
                            <li>PL wins if all keywords have been found. (AND altered!)</li>
                            <li>If even one PL is alive and even one keyword was not found, the GM will take a vote by asking if the story remained scary at the end. If yes, GM wins, if no, its a Tie.</li>
                        </ul></li>
                    </ul>
                    </li>
                </li>
                <li>Usually takes 1 hour for a single session</li>
                <li>Lastly, this is a "game" but its not too much about win or losing, it has a huge emphasis on having fun!</li>
            </ul>

        </p>

        <h2>How to use the tool</h2>
        <p>The tool is not for connecting with players, it is for the GM to keep track, and they can screen share it if they want.</p>
        <ul>On the right is the players status, only the PLs' info is needed.
            <li>Add players with the button, it will also keep count of number of players</li>
            <li>You can delete a player with the "X" on the right side of each player, it will take 2 clicks, one for the "X" and one for the "X?"</li>
            <li>You can double click the name to change it, type in your name</li>
            <li>Left side of the name if is the HP, it should set to default value when selecting the class, feel free to adjust, and decrease as they take damage</li>
            <li>The right of the name has the person's job and number in the drop down</li>
        </ul>
        <ul>The left is the tools for the story
            <li>Click on the huge number box to roll a dice (1~6), it will shuffle, then land on a number shortly</li>
            <li>Story control, (this is after choosing a file to upload, explained later) you can type a word to change in the first box, and change to the word in the second box, click "Change word" to change all occurences of that word </li>
            <li>The "Next" button is to progress the story, when you first upload the txt file, it will show one line every time you press next (for spoiler proof purpose)</li>
        </ul>
        <ul>The main section (where it says "Hakumonogatari")
            <li>Choose file, then pick a txt file, should be the following format in the text file:

                    <li>(Line 2)Keywords Separated by a comma (EX: Keyword1, Key_word_2, Key Word 3) there are no limits, but use 10 as default</li>
                    <li>(Line 3 and onwards) The story, ideally, each sentence is on a new line if you want it to be spoiler proof</li>
                </ul>
            </li>
        </ul>
